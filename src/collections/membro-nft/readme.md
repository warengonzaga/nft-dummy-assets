Membro NFT is a dummy NFT membership asset composed of 500 pieces of unique CSV metadata with one image asset to represent them all, created by [Waren Gonzaga](https://warengonzaga.com) manually using the [GIMP](https://gimp.org). Recommended for doing a test on deploying **ERC-721** unique metadata using CSV file with one image asset only as a representation of your NFT membership.
